PM NOTES: 
1. Cross-Consensus Message Format (XCM). The long-promised primitive is now live.
2. Moonbeam + XCM connects Polkadot to other chains without the need for bridges.
3. Simplicity is key. Polkadot realizes that UX matters to the future of crypto adoption, and WASM unlocks the 
ability to abstract.
4. Governance was already good, but the Fellowship program and referendum classification system makes it 
even better
